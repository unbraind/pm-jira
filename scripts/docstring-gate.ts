 * Enforce meaningful docstrings across pm-jira source declarations.

 * The analyzer comes from pm-ops so the fleet shares one lexer-backed policy:
 * every exported declaration, every public member of an exported class, and
 * every substantial private function needs JSDoc that contributes information
 * beyond its identifier. The analyzer has no ignore list and treats unknown
 * declaration forms as violations, so a new syntax form fails closed.
 *
 * This script is intentionally self-contained: pm-jira has no shared script
 * launcher, so the main-invocation guard and the result contract live here

 * Whether this module is the process entry point rather than a test import.

 * `realpathSync` and converted to a URL before comparison. A launcher reaching
 * this file through a symlink (an npm bin shim, a linked workspace) would
 * otherwise compare unequal and skip the gate silently.
 *
 * An unresolvable `argv[1]` **propagates** rather than returning false. The two
 * outcomes are not equally safe: returning false means `npm run docstring`
 * exits 0 having scanned nothing, which is a required release check reporting
 * success without doing its job — the one failure this gate exists to prevent.
 * Letting `realpathSync` throw turns that into a loud non-zero exit. The case
 * requires `argv[1]` to stop resolving after Node has already loaded this file,
 * so in practice it means the environment is broken, and a broken environment
 * must not silently satisfy a gate.
 *
 * A genuinely different entry path still returns false, which is how a test
 * importing this module declines to run the gate.
 *
 * @param argv - The process argv to inspect.
 * @param moduleUrl - The `import.meta.url` of the module that might be main.
 * @returns True when `argv[1]` resolves to this module's own URL, false when it
 *          resolves to something else.
 * @throws Whatever `realpathSync` throws when `argv[1]` cannot be resolved.
